# Horiseon-web-page-refactor
This weekly Challenge was to refractor an existing html code to make it more accessible and to improve SEO.
Within this repository you will find the index.html that holds the code for the Horiseon webite and also included in the repository is a folder called asset, that holds the css file and the images file.
Changes were made in both the html and css files
